[[$uiRouterProvider]]: The UI-Router instance\r\n * - [[$stateProvider]]: State registration\r\n * - [[$transitionsProvider]]: Transition hooks\r\n * - [[$urlServiceProvider]]: All URL related public APIs\r\n *\r\n * - [[$uiViewScrollProvider]]: Disable ui-router view scrolling\r\n * - [[$urlRouterProvider]]: (deprecated) Url matching rules\r\n * - [[$urlMatcherFactoryProvider]]: (deprecated) Url parsing config\r\n *\r\n * ## **Service** objects\r\n * #### injectable globally during runtime\r\n *\r\n * - [[$uiRouter]]: The UI-Router instance\r\n * - [[$trace]]: Enable transition trace/debug\r\n * - [[$transitions]]: Transition hooks\r\n * - [[$state]]: Imperative state related APIs\r\n * - [[$stateRegistry]]: State registration\r\n * - [[$urlService]]: All URL related public APIs\r\n * - [[$uiRouterGlobals]]: Global variables\r\n * - [[$uiViewScroll]]: Scroll an element into view\r\n *\r\n * - [[$stateParams]]: (deprecated) Global state param values\r\n * - [[$urlRouter]]: (deprecated) URL synchronization\r\n * - [[$urlMatcherFactory]]: (deprecated) URL parsing config\r\n *\r\n * ## **Per-Transition** objects\r\n *\r\n * - These kind of objects are injectable into:\r\n *   - Resolves ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]),\r\n *   - Transition Hooks ([[TransitionService.onStart]], etc),\r\n *   - Routed Controllers ([[Ng1ViewDeclaration.controller]])\r\n *\r\n * #### Different instances are injected based on the [[Transition]]\r\n *\r\n * - [[$transition$]]: The current Transition object\r\n * - [[$stateParams]]: State param values for pending Transition (deprecated)\r\n * - Any resolve data defined using [[Ng1StateDeclaration.resolve]]\r\n *\r\n * @preferred @publicapi @module injectables\r\n */ /** */\r\nimport { StateProvider } from './stateProvider';\r\nimport {\r\n  StateService,\r\n  TransitionService,\r\n  Transition,\r\n  UrlRouter,\r\n  UrlMatcherFactory,\r\n  StateParams,\r\n  StateRegistry,\r\n  UIRouterGlobals,\r\n  UIRouter,\r\n  Trace,\r\n  UrlService,\r\n} from '@uirouter/core';\r\nimport { UIViewScrollProvider } from './viewScroll';\r\nimport { UrlRouterProvider } from './urlRouterProvider';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The current (or pending) State Parameters\r\n *\r\n * An injectable global **Service Object** which holds the state parameters for the latest **SUCCESSFUL** transition.\r\n *\r\n * The values are not updated until *after* a `Transition` successfully completes.\r\n *\r\n * **Also:** an injectable **Per-Transition Object** object which holds the pending state parameters for the pending `Transition` currently running.\r\n *\r\n * ### Deprecation warning:\r\n *\r\n * The value injected for `$stateParams` is different depending on where it is injected.\r\n *\r\n * - When injected into an angular service, the object injected is the global **Service Object** with the parameter values for the latest successful `Transition`.\r\n * - When injected into transition hooks, resolves, or view controllers, the object is the **Per-Transition Object** with the parameter values for the running `Transition`.\r\n *\r\n * Because of these confusing details, this service is deprecated.\r\n *\r\n * ### Instead of using the global `$stateParams` service object,\r\n * inject [[$uiRouterGlobals]] and use [[UIRouterGlobals.params]]\r\n *\r\n * ```js\r\n * MyService.$inject = ['$uiRouterGlobals'];\r\n * function MyService($uiRouterGlobals) {\r\n *   return {\r\n *     paramValues: function () {\r\n *       return $uiRouterGlobals.params;\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * ### Instead of using the per-transition `$stateParams` object,\r\n * inject the current `Transition` (as [[$transition$]]) and use [[Transition.params]]\r\n *\r\n * ```js\r\n * MyController.$inject = ['$transition$'];\r\n * function MyController($transition$) {\r\n *   var username = $transition$.params().username;\r\n *   // .. do something with username\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * ---\r\n *\r\n * This object can be injected into other services.\r\n *\r\n * #### Deprecated Example:\r\n * ```js\r\n * SomeService.$inject = ['$http', '$stateParams'];\r\n * function SomeService($http, $stateParams) {\r\n *   return {\r\n *     getUser: function() {\r\n *       return $http.get('/api/users/' + $stateParams.username);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * };\r\n * angular.service('SomeService', SomeService);\r\n * ```\r\n * @deprecated\r\n */\r\nlet $stateParams: StateParams;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Global UI-Router variables\r\n *\r\n * The router global state as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\r\n *\r\n * This object contains globals such as the current state and current parameter values.\r\n */\r\nlet $uiRouterGlobals: UIRouterGlobals;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The UI-Router instance\r\n *\r\n * The [[UIRouter]] singleton (the router instance) as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\r\n *\r\n * This object is the UI-Router singleton instance, created by angular dependency injection during application bootstrap.\r\n * It has references to the other UI-Router services\r\n *\r\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$uiRouterProvider]] for injection during angular config time.\r\n */\r\nlet $uiRouter: UIRouter;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The UI-Router instance\r\n *\r\n * The [[UIRouter]] singleton (the router instance) as a **Provider Object** (injectable during config phase).\r\n *\r\n * This object is the UI-Router singleton instance, created by angular dependency injection during application bootstrap.\r\n * It has references to the other UI-Router services\r\n *\r\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$uiRouter]] for injection during runtime.\r\n */\r\nlet $uiRouterProvider: UIRouter;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Transition debug/tracing\r\n *\r\n * The [[Trace]] singleton as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\r\n *\r\n * Enables or disables Transition tracing which can help to debug issues.\r\n */\r\nlet $trace: Trace;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The Transition Service\r\n *\r\n * The [[TransitionService]] singleton as a **Service Object** (injectable during runtime).\r\n *\r\n * This angular service exposes the [[TransitionService]] singleton, which is primarily\r\n * used to register global transition hooks.\r\n *\r\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$transitionsProvider]] for injection during the config phase.\r\n */\r\nlet $transitions: TransitionService;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The Transition Service\r\n *\r\n * The [[TransitionService]] singleton as a **Provider Object** (injectable during config phase)\r\n *\r\n * This angular service exposes the [[TransitionService]] singleton, which is primarily\r\n * used to register global transition hooks.\r\n *\r\n * #### Note: This object is also exposed as [[$transitions]] for injection during runtime.\r\n */\r\nlet $transitionsProvider: TransitionService;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The current [[Transition]] object\r\n *\r\n * The current [[Transition]] object as a **Per-Transition Object** (injectable into Resolve, Hooks, Controllers)\r\n *\r\n * This object returns information about the current transition, including:\r\n *\r\n * -
